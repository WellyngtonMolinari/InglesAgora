Once upon a time in a vibrant forest in Brazil, there lived a parrot named Pedro. Pedro was not just any parrot; he was bright, colorful, and very curious about the world beyond the trees. He loved to mimic the sounds of the forest, but what he enjoyed most was trying to speak English, a language he heard from the tourists who often visited.

One sunny morning, Pedro decided it was time for an adventure. "Today, I will explore and practice my English!" he declared. With a flutter of his wings, he set off into the unknown.

As he flew over the canopy, he saw a group of hikers. "Hello! How are you?" Pedro called out. The hikers were delighted to hear a parrot speaking English and laughed with joy. "We're good, thank you!" they replied. Pedro felt proud and continued his journey.

Hours passed, and soon Pedro realized he had flown too far from home. The trees looked unfamiliar, and the sounds of the forest were different. He had lost his way. Feeling a bit scared, he perched on a branch and thought, "What should I do?"

Just then, a friendly toucan named Tina appeared. "Are you lost?" she asked in Portuguese. Pedro nodded and explained his situation in English, mixing in some Portuguese words. Tina didn't understand English, but she could tell Pedro needed help.

Together, they found a park ranger who spoke both languages. "I can help you get home," the ranger said in English. Pedro was relieved and grateful. On their way back, the ranger taught Pedro more English words, and Pedro taught the ranger some parrot talk.

Finally, as the sun was setting, Pedro saw his home forest. He thanked the ranger and Tina and promised to visit them again. "I had an adventure and made new friends!" Pedro chirped happily. "And I learned that it's okay to ask for help, no matter what language you speak."

**The End.**
